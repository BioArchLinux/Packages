## PKGBUILD

The PKGBUILD writing guide is give by [PKGBUILD page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) on ArchWiki, you can find different ways to write PKGBUILD developed by coding language.

Also, you can refer to the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) if you are a beginner. And the [Arch Forum](https://bbs.archlinux.org/) and our [discussions](https://github.com/BioArchLinux/Packages/discussions) would be a great place to discuss the related issues.
